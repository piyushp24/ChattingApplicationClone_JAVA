# ChattingApplicationClone_JAVA
This project is a Chatting Application Clone implemented in Java, demonstrating basic client-server communication. The application consists of two main components:

Server: Handles incoming connections and facilitates communication between clients.
Client: Connects to the server to enable real-time messaging.
The connection between the server and client is established using Socket Programming. This ensures reliable communication, allowing both the server and client to exchange messages seamlessly.

Features
Real-Time Chatting: Both server and client can send and receive messages in real time.
User Interface: A simple and user-friendly interface is built using Java Swing components.
Socket Programming: Establishes and maintains the connection between the server and client.
Technologies and Libraries Used
Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
Socket Programming: For handling communication between server and client.
Java AWT: Provides additional UI components and layout management.
Java Event Handling: Manages user interactions and events.
